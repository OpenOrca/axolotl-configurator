# axolotl-configurator

An online configurator for building Axolotl Yaml files!

Roadmap:
1. Add support for passing your own HF API Key to view private repositories
2. Set up a database to save/share your configs.

## Running Locally:
Make sure you have NodeJS installed
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenOrca/axolotl-configurator.git
cd axolotl-configurator
npm install
npm run dev
```
